abstract = {The complexity of the human brain has made it difficult to study many brain disorders in model organisms, highlighting the need for an in vitro model of human brain development. Here we have developed a human pluripotent stem cell-derived three-dimensional organoid culture system, termed cerebral organoids, that develop various discrete, although interdependent, brain regions. These include a cerebral cortex containing progenitor populations that organize and produce mature cortical neuron subtypes. Furthermore, cerebral organoids are shown to recapitulate features of human cortical development, namely characteristic progenitor zone organization with abundant outer radial glial stem cells. Finally, we use RNA interference and patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells to model microcephaly, a disorder that has been difficult to recapitulate in mice. We demonstrate premature neuronal differentiation in patient organoids, a defect that could help to explain the disease phenotype. Together, these data show that three-dimensional organoids can recapitulate development and disease even in this most complex human tissue.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s). Maintenance of genomic integrity is one of the critical features for proper neurodevelopment and inhibition of neurological diseases. The signals from both ATM and ATR to TP53 are well-known mechanisms to remove neural cells with DNA damage during neurogenesis. Here we examined the involvement of Atm and Atr in genomic instability due to Terf2 inactivation during mouse brain development. Selective inactivation of Terf2 in neural progenitors induced apoptosis, resulting in a complete loss of the brain structure. This neural loss was rescued partially in both Atm and Trp53 deficiency, but not in an Atr-deficient background in the mouse. Atm inactivation resulted in incomplete brain structures, whereas p53 deficiency led to the formation of multinucleated giant neural cells and the disruption of the brain structure. These giant neural cells disappeared in Lig4 deficiency. These data demonstrate ATM and TP53 are important for the maintenance of telomere homeostasis and the surveillance of telomere dysfunction during neurogenesis.},

abstract = {During cerebellar development, the main portion of the cerebellar plate neuroepithelium gives birth to Purkinje cells and interneurons, whereas the rhombic lip, the germinal zone at its dorsal edge, generates granule cells and cerebellar nuclei neurons. However, it remains elusive how these components cooperate to form the intricate cerebellar structure. Here, we found that a polarized cerebellar structure self-organizes in 3D human embryonic stem cell (ESC) culture. The self-organized neuroepithelium differentiates into electrophysiologically functional Purkinje cells. The addition of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) promotes spontaneous generation of dorsoventrally polarized neural-tube-like structures at the level of the cerebellum. Furthermore, addition of SDF1 and FGF19 promotes the generation of a continuous cerebellar plate neuroepithelium with rhombic-lip-like structure at one end and a three-layer cytoarchitecture similar to the embryonic cerebellum. Thus, human-ESC-derived cerebellar progenitors exhibit substantial self-organizing potential for generating a polarized structure reminiscent of the early human cerebellum at the first trimester.},

abstract = {Mutations in the evolutionarily conserved codons of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are common in diverse types of human cancer. The p53 mutational spectrum differs among cancers of the colon, lung, esophagus, breast, liver, brain, reticuloendothelial tissues, and hemopoietic tissues. Analysis of these mutations can provide clues to the etiology of these diverse tumors and to the function of specific regions of p53. Transitions predominate in colon, brain, and lymphoid malignancies, whereas G:C to T:A transversions are the most frequent substitutions observed in cancers of the lung and liver. Mutations at A:T base pairs are seen more frequently in esophageal carcinomas than in other solid tumors. Most transitions in colorectal carcinomas, brain tumors, leukemias, and lymphomas are at CpG dinucleotide mutational hot spots. G to T transversions in lung, breast, and esophageal carcinomas are dispersed among numerous codons. In liver tumors in persons from geographic areas in which both aflatoxin B1 and hepatitis B virus are cancer risk factors, most mutations are at one nucleotide pair of codon 249. These differences may reflect the etiological contributions of both exogenous and endogenous factors to human carcinogenesis.},

Because inhibition of mutant p53 is considered to be a promising therapeutic strategy to treat these diseases, LFS provides a perfect genetic model to study p53 mutation-associated malignancies as well as to screen potential compounds targeting oncogenic p53. In this review we briefly summarize the biology of LFS and current understanding of the oncogenic functions of mutant p53 in cancer development. We discuss the strengths and limitations of current LFS disease models, and touch on existing compounds targeting oncogenic p53 and in vitro clinical trials to develop new ones. Finally, we discuss how recently developed methodologies can be integrated into the LFS induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) platform to develop precision cancer therapy.},

To systematically profile proteome dynamics throughout neuronal differentiation, we took cultured rat hippocampal neurons at different developmental stages and monitored changes in protein abundance using a combination of stable isotope labeling and high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Almost one third of all 4,500 proteins quantified underwent a more than 2-fold expression change during neuronal differentiation, indicating extensive remodeling of the neuron proteome. To highlight the strength of our resource, we studied the neural-cell-adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) and found that it stimulates dendritic arbor development by promoting actin filament growth at the dendritic growth cone. We anticipate that our quantitative map of neuronal proteome dynamics is a rich resource for further analyses of the many identified proteins in various neurodevelopmental processes.},

To determine whether Mdm2 and Mdm4 inhibit p53 function redundantly in a more restricted cell type, conditional alleles were crossed to a neuronal specific Cre transgene to delete Mdm2 and Mdm4 in the CNS. Mice lacking Mdm2 in the CNS developed hydranencephaly at embryonic day 12.5 due to apoptosis, whereas Mdm4 deletion showed a proencephaly phenotype at embryonic day 17.5 because of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The deletion of both genes, strikingly, contributed to an even earlier and more severe CNS phenotype. Additionally, Mdm2 and Mdm4 had a gene dosage effect, because loss of three of the four Mdm alleles also showed a more accelerated CNS phenotype than deletion of either gene alone. All phenotypes were rescued by deletion of p53. Thus, these in vivo data demonstrate the importance of Mdm4 independent of Mdm2 in inhibition of p53.},

abstract = {The formation of complex nervous systems requires processes that coordinate proliferation, migration and differentiation of neuronal cells. The remarkable morphological transformations of neurons as they migrate, extend axons and dendrites and establish synaptic connections, imply a strictly regulated process of structural organization and dynamic remodeling of the cytoskeleton. The centrosome serves as the main cytoskeleton-organizing center in the cell and is the classical site of microtubule nucleation and anchoring. Mutations in genes encoding centrosomal proteins cause severe neurodevelopmental disorders that lead to several neuropsychiatric diseases, such as lissencephaly, microcephaly and schizophrenia. While the centrosome has been considered crucial for coordinating neuronal migration and polarization, accumulating experimental findings seems to rule out a central role for the centrosome at later stages of neuronal development. Here, we will review these observations and discuss the importance of centrosomal and acentrosomal microtubule organization for neuronal development.

Because of its potent tumor suppressive activity, it is widely assumed that a molecular understanding of p53 action will produce fundamental insights into natural processes that limit tumorigenesis and may identify key molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. p53 functions largely as a transcription factor, and can trigger a variety of antiproliferative programs by activating or repressing key effector genes. Despite a significant body of literature detailing the biochemical and biological functions of p53, much remains to be elucidated. Indeed, the p53 network is as complex and enigmatic as it is relevant. It is the goal of this article, written 30 years after the discovery of p53, to present a concise review of the tumor suppressor role of the p53 network and to highlight the context-dependent nature of p53 target-gene functions.},

We used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to target an HRasG12V-IRES-tdTomato construct by homologous recombination into the TP53 locus. Results show that transformed cells rapidly become invasive and destroy surrounding organoid structures, overwhelming the entire organoid. Tumor cells in the organoids can be orthotopically xenografted into immunodeficient NOD/SCID IL2RG−/−animals, exhibiting an invasive phenotype. Organoid-generated putative tumor cells show gene expression profiles consistent with mesenchymal subtype human glioblastoma. We further demonstrate that human-organoid-derived tumor cell lines or primary human-patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines can be transplanted into human cerebral organoids to establish invasive tumor-like structures. Our results show potential for the use of organoids as a platform to test human cancer phenotypes that recapitulate key aspects of malignancy. Ogawa et al. show that human cerebral organoids can be used as a platform for tumor formation. CRISPR/Cas9 manipulation of oncogenes/tumor suppressors initiates tumorigenesis in cerebral organoids, allowing microscopic observation of tumor development.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The role of p73, the homologue of the tumor suppressor p53, in regulating angiogenesis has recently been extensively investigated, resulting in the publication of five articles. Of these, two studies suggested a suppressive role, while the others implied a stimulatory role for the p73 isoforms in regulating angiogenesis. A negative role for TAp73, the full-length form that is often associated with tumor suppression, in blood vessel formation, is consistent with its general attributes and was proposed to be effected indirectly through the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1$\alpha$ (HIF1-$\alpha$), the master angiogenic regulator. In contrast, a positive role for TAp73 coincides with its recently understood role in supporting cellular survival and thus tumorigenesis, consistent with TAp73 being not-mutated but rather often overexpressed in clinical contexts. In the latter case, TAp73 expression was induced by hypoxia via HIF1-$\alpha$, and it appears to directly promote angiogenic target gene activation and blood vessel formation independent of HIF1-$\alpha$. This mini review will provide an overview of these seemingly opposite recent findings as well as earlier data, which collectively establish the definite possibility that TAp73 is indeed capable of both promoting and inhibiting angiogenesis, depending on the cellular context.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In particular, iPSC-derived neural cells permit a direct comparison of disease-relevant molecular pathways in neurons and glia derived from patients and healthy individuals. A prerequisite for such comparative studies are robust protocols that efficiently yield standardized populations of neural cell types. Here we show that long-term self-renewing neuroepithelial-like stem cells (lt-NES cells) derived from 3 hESC and 6 iPSC lines in two independent laboratories exhibit consistent characteristics including i) continuous expandability in the presence of FGF2 and EGF; ii) stable neuronal and glial differentiation competence; iii) characteristic transcription factor profile; iv) hindbrain specification amenable to regional patterning; v) capacity to generate functionally mature human neurons. We further show that lt-NES cells are developmentally distinct from fetal tissue-derived radial glia-like stem cells. We propose that lt-NES cells provide an interesting tool for studying human neurodevelopment and may serve as a standard system to facilitate comparative analyses of hESC and hiPSC-derived neural cells from control and diseased genetic backgrounds.},

abstract = {The p53 tumour-suppressor protein exerts antiproliferative effects, including growth arrest and apoptosis, in response to various types of stress. The activity of p53 is abrogated by mutations that occur frequently in tumours, as well as by several viral and cellular proteins. The Mdm2 oncoprotein is a potent inhibitor of p53. Mdm2 binds the transcriptional activation domain of p53 and blocks its ability to regulate target genes and to exert antiproliferative effects. On the other hand, p53 activates the expression of the mdm2 gene in an autoregulatory feedback loop. The interval between p53 activation and consequent Mdm2 accumulation defines a time window during which p53 exerts its effects. We now report that Mdm2 also promotes the rapid degradation of p53 under conditions in which p53 is otherwise stabilized. This effect of Mdm2 requires binding of p53; moreover, a small domain of p53, encompassing the Mdm2-binding site, confers Mdm2-dependent detstabilization upon heterologous proteins. Raised amounts of Mdm2 strongly repress mutant p53 accumulation in tumour-derived cells. During recovery from DNA damage, maximal Mdm2 induction coincides with rapid p53 loss. We propose that the Mdm2-promoted degradation of p53 provides a new mechanism to ensure effective termination of the p53 signal.},

Among the factors that have previously been reported to enhance direct reprogramming, LIN28, but not Nanog homeobox (NANOG), Cyclin D1, or p53 shRNA, significantly inhibited the reversion of reprogramming.

abstract = {How metabolism is reprogrammed during neuronal differentiation is unknown. We found that the loss of hexokinase (HK2) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) expression, together with a switch in pyruvate kinase gene splicing from PKM2 to PKM1, marks the transition from aerobic glycolysis in neural progenitor cells (NPC) to neuronal oxidative phosphorylation. The protein levels of c-MYC and N-MYC, transcriptional activators of the HK2 and LDHA genes, decrease dramatically. Constitutive expression of HK2 and LDHA during differentiation leads to neuronal cell death, indicating that the shut-off aerobic glycolysis is essential for neuronal survival. The metabolic regulators PGC-1$\alpha$ and ERR$\gamma$ increase significantly upon neuronal differentiation to sustain the transcription of metabolic and mitochondrial genes, whose levels are unchanged compared to NPCs, revealing distinct transcriptional regulation of metabolic genes in the proliferation and post-mitotic differentiation states. Mitochondrial mass increases proportionally with neuronal mass growth, indicating an unknown mechanism linking mitochondrial biogenesis to cell size.},

We have taken advantage of a chick in vivo model to examine their role in progenitor cells of the developing neural tube. Our results show that depletion of endogenous MYC in radial glial precursors (RGPs) is incompatible with differentiation and conversely, that overexpression of MYC induces neurogenesis independently of premature or upregulated expression of proneural gene programs. Unexpectedly, the neurogenic function of MYC depends on the integrity of the polarized neural tissue, in contrast to the situation in dissociated RGPs where MYC is mitogenic. Within the polarized RGPs of the neural tube, MYC drives differentiation by inhibiting Notch signaling and by increasing neurogenic cell division, eventually resulting in a depletion of progenitor cells. These results reveal an unexpected role of MYC in the control of stemness versus differentiation of neural stem cells in vivo.},

However, in some of the most difficult-to-treat cancers such as high-grade serous ovarian cancers, triple-negative breast cancers, oesophageal cancers, small-cell lung cancers and squamous cell lung cancers, p53 is mutated in at least 80{\%} of samples. Clearly, therefore, mutant p53 protein is an important candidate target against which new anticancer treatments could be developed. Although traditionally regarded as undruggable, several compounds such as p53 reactivation and induction of massive apoptosis-1 (PRIMA-1), a methylated derivative and structural analogue of PRIMA-1, i.e. APR-246, 2-sulfonylpyrimidines such as PK11007, pyrazoles such as PK7088, zinc metallochaperone-1 (ZMC1), a third generation thiosemicarbazone developed by Critical Outcome Techonologies Inc. (COTI-2) as well as specific peptides have recently been reported to reactive mutant p53 protein by converting it to a form exhibiting wild-type properties. Consistent with the reactivation of mutant p53, these compounds have been shown to exhibit anticancer activity in preclinical models expressing mutant p53. To date, two of these compounds, i.e. APR-246 and COTI-2 have progressed to clinical trials. A phase I/IIa clinical trial with APR-246 reported no major adverse effect. Currently, APR-246 is undergoing a phase Ib/II trial in patients with advanced serous ovarian cancer, while COTI-2 is being evaluated in a phase I trial in patients with advanced gynaecological cancers. It remains to be shown however, whether any mutant p53 reactivating compound has efficacy for the treatment of human cancer.},

This is accompanied by elevated Smad1 expression/activation in the brain and NSC, which contributes to accelerated neuronal differentiation of p53(-/-) NSCs. p53 deficiency also leads to upregulation of Id1, whose expression is repressed by p53 in BMP-Smad1-dependent and -independent manners. Elevated Id1 expression contributes to augmented proliferation and, unexpectedly, accelerated neuronal differentiation of p53(-/-) NSCs as well. This study reveals a molecular mechanism by which tumor suppressor p53 controls NSC proliferation and differentiation and establishes a connection between p53 and Id1.},

abstract = {p53, p63 and p73 are members of the p53 gene family involved in development, differentiation and response to cellular stress. p53 gene is a transcription factor essential for the prevention of cancer formation. The p53 pathway is ubiquitously lost in human cancer either by p53 gene mutation (60{\%} of cancers) or by lost of cell signalling upstream and downstream of p53 in the remaining cancers expressing WTp53 gene. As p53 pathway inactivation is a common denominator to all cancers, the understanding of p53 tumour suppressor activity is likely to bring us closer to cancer therapy. However, despite all the experimental evidences showing the importance of p53 in preventing carcinogenesis, it is difficult in clinical studies to link p53 status to cancer treatment and clinical outcome. The recent discovery that p53 gene encodes for nine different p53 proteins (isoforms) may have a profound impact on our understanding of p53 tumour suppressor activity. Studies in several tumour types have shown that the nine different p53 isoforms are abnormally expressed in tumour tissues compared to normal cells. p53 protein isoforms modulate p53 transcriptional activity and cell fate outcome in response to stress. Regulation of p53 function in normal and tumour tissues in man is likely to be more complex than has been hitherto appreciated. Therefore, the tumour p53 status needs to be determined more accurately by integrating p53 isoform expression, functional p53 mutation analysis and a panel of antibodies specific of p53 and of its target genes.},

abstract = {With few exceptions, the marked advances in knowledge about the genetic basis of schizophrenia have not converged on findings that can be confidently used for precise experimental modeling. By applying knowledge of the cellular taxonomy of the brain from single-cell RNA sequencing, we evaluated whether the genomic loci implicated in schizophrenia map onto specific brain cell types. We found that the common-variant genomic results consistently mapped to pyramidal cells, medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and certain interneurons, but far less consistently to embryonic, progenitor or glial cells. These enrichments were due to sets of genes that were specifically expressed in each of these cell types. We also found that many of the diverse gene sets previously associated with schizophrenia (genes involved in synaptic function, those encoding mRNAs that interact with FMRP, antipsychotic targets, etc.) generally implicated the same brain cell types. Our results suggest a parsimonious explanation: the common-variant genetic results for schizophrenia point at a limited set of neurons, and the gene sets point to the same cells. The genetic risk associated with MSNs did not overlap with that of glutamatergic pyramidal cells and interneurons, suggesting that different cell types have biologically distinct roles in schizophrenia.},

abstract = {An intriguing question in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) biology is whether these pluripotent cells can give rise to stably expandable somatic stem cells, which are still amenable to extrinsic fate instruction. Here, we present a pure population of long-term self-renewing rosette-type hESC-derived neural stem cells (lt-hESNSCs), which exhibit extensive self-renewal, clonogenicity, and stable neurogenesis. Although lt-hESNSCs show a restricted expression of regional transcription factors, they retain responsiveness to instructive cues promoting the induction of distinct subpopulations, such as ventral midbrain and spinal cord fates. Using lt-hESNSCs as a donor source for neural transplantation, we provide direct evidence that hESC-derived neurons can establish synaptic connectivity with the mammalian nervous system. Combining long-term stability, maintenance of rosette-properties and phenotypic plasticity, lt-hESNSCs may serve as useful tool to study mechanisms of human NSC self-renewal, lineage segregation, and functional in vivo integration.},

However, the extent to which in vitro organoid systems recapitulate neural progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation programs observed in vivo remains unclear. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect and compare cell composition and progenitor-to-neuron lineage relationships in human cerebral organoids and fetal neocortex. Covariation network analysis using the fetal neocortex data reveals known and previously unidentified interactions among genes central to neural progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation. In the organoid, we detect diverse progenitors and differentiated cell types of neuronal and mesenchymal lineages and identify cells that derived from regions resembling the fetal neocortex. We find that these organoid cortical cells use gene expression programs remarkably similar to those of the fetal tissue to organize into cerebral cortex-like regions. Our comparison of in vivo and in vitro cortical single-cell transcriptomes illuminates the genetic features underlying human cortical development that can be studied in organoid cultures.},

This discrepancy mainly results from the lack of molecular and cellular mechanisms and the general fact that p53 activation requires stresses. Recent studies of p53 in mouse and human ES cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells shed new light on the mechanisms of the developmental roles of p53. This review summarizes these new studies that support the developmental roles of p53, highlights the possible underlying molecular mechanisms, and discusses the potential relationship between the developmental roles and the tumor suppressive function of p53. In summary, the molecular mechanisms underlying the developmental roles of p53 are emerging, and the developmental roles and tumor suppressive function of p53 may be closely related.},

Here we review our current understanding of neocortical interneuron diversity and the properties that distinguish cell types. We then discuss how the involvement of multiple cell types, each with a specific set of cellular properties, plays a crucial role in diversifying and increasing the computational power of a relatively small number of simple circuit motifs forming cortical networks. We illustrate how recent advances in the field have shed light onto the mechanisms by which GABAergic inhibition contributes to network operations.},

The patterning events driving this self-organization are currently unknown. Here, we examine the developmental and differentiative capacity of cerebral organoids. Focusing on forebrain regions, we demonstrate the presence of a variety of discrete ventral and dorsal regions. Clearing and subse-quent 3D reconstruction of entire organoids reveal that many of these regions are interconnected, suggesting that the entire range of dorso-ventral identities can be generated within continuous neuroepithelia. Consistent with this, we demonstrate the presence of forebrain organizing centers that express secreted growth factors, which may be involved in dorso-ventral patterning within organoids. Furthermore, we demonstrate the timed generation of neurons with mature morphologies, as well as the subsequent generation of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Our work provides the methodology and quality criteria for phenotypic analysis of brain organoids and shows that the spatial and temporal pattern-ing events governing human brain development can be recapitu-lated in vitro.},

abstract = {p53 is a transcription factor with a key role in the maintenance of genetic stability and therefore preventing cancer formation. It belongs to a family of genes composed of p53, p63, and p73. The p63 and p73 genes have a dual gene structure with an internal promoter in intron-3 and together with alternative splicing, can express 6 and 29 mRNA variants, respectively. Such a complex expression pattern had not been previously described for the p53 gene, which was not consistent with our understanding of the evolution of the p53 gene family. Consequently, we revisited the human p53 gene structure and established that it encodes nine different p53 protein isoforms because of alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage, and alternative initiation sites of translation. Therefore, the human p53 gene family (p53, p63, and p73) has a dual gene structure. We determined that the dual gene structure is conserved in Drosophila and in zebrafish p53 genes. The conservation through evolution of the dual gene structure suggests that the p53 isoforms play an important role in p53 tumor-suppressor activity. We and others have established that the p53 isoforms can regulate cell-fate outcome in response to stress, by modulating p53 transcriptional activity in a promoter and stress-dependent manner. We have also shown that the p53 isoforms are abnormally expressed in several types of human cancers, suggesting that they play an important role in cancer formation. The determination of p53 isoforms' expression may help to link clinical outcome to p53 status and to improve cancer patient treatment.},

However, other authors describe the occurrence of resident stem cells in the OB. In the present work we report that the absence of tumor suppressor protein p53 increases the number of neurosphere-forming cells and the proliferation of stem cells derived from 13.5-day embryo OB. Interestingly, differentiation of p53 knockout-derived neurospheres was biased toward neuronal precursors, suggesting a role for p53 in the differentiation process. Moreover, we demonstrate the relevance of p53 in maintaining chromosomal stability in response to genotoxic insult. Finally, our data show that neurosphere stem cells are highly resistant to long-term epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) deprivation in a p53-independent fashion, and they preserve their differentiation potential. Thus, these data demonstrate that p53 controls the proliferation, chromosomal stability and differentiation pattern of embryonic mouse olfactory bulb stem cells. {\textcopyright} 2009 IBRO.},

abstract = {Hippocampus plays an important role in learning and memory and in spatial navigation. Production of new neurons that are functionally integrated into the hippocampal neuronal network is important for the maintenance of functional plasticity. In adults, production of new neurons in the hippocampus takes place in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of dentate gyrus. Neural progenitor/stem cells go through processes of proliferation, differentiation, migration, and maturation. This process is exquisitely sensitive to oxidative stress, and perturbation in the redox balance in the neurogenic microenvironment can lead to reduced neurogenesis. Cranial irradiation is an effective treatment for primary and secondary brain tumors. However, even low doses of irradiation can lead to persistent elevation of oxidative stress and sustained suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are major antioxidant enzymes for the removal of superoxide radicals in different subcellular compartments. To identify the subcellular location where reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continuously generated after cranial irradiation, different SOD deficient mice have been used to determine the effects of irradiation on hippocampal neurogenesis. The study results suggest that, regardless of the subcellular location, SOD deficiency leads to a significant reduction in the production of new neurons in the SGZ of hippocampal dentate gyrus. In exchange, the generation of new glial cells was significantly increased. The SOD deficient condition, however, altered the tissue response to irradiation, and SOD deficient mice were able to maintain a similar level of neurogenesis after irradiation while wild type mice showed a significant reduction in the production of new neurons. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Background: Several strains of mice carrying null mutations of the tumour suppressor gene p53 have been developed. It has been reported that homozygous mice from all of these strains develop normally to birth, but then succumb rapidly to neoplasia. Results Here, we report that a significant proportion of female p53-/-mice die during embryogenesis or in the period between birth and weaning, being subject to a spectrum of abnormalities. In a significant proportion (23 {\%}) of p53-/-female embryos, the normal process of neural tube closure failed, leading to exencephaly and subsequent anencephaly. Although this phenomenon was predominantly associated with females, we observed one affected male embryo. In addition to a spectrum of neural tube defects, many of these embryos exhibited a range of craniofacial malformations, including ocular abnormalities and defects in upper incisor tooth formation. We observed a significant reduction in the number of p53-/-female progeny of p53+/-× p53+/-matings, and also in an in utero analysis of the p53+/-female progeny of p53-/-× p53+/+matings. When male mice were exposed to irradiation prior to mating, a significant increase in the rate of abnormality was seen in the progeny, which was specifically associated with p53 deficiency. Conclusion We have identified a high rate of developmental abnormalities associated with p53 deficiency. This manifests itself as a spectrum of lesions, predominantly female-associated defects in neural tube closure. These defects may arise either because p53 plays a physiological role at the time of neural tube closure, or because of an abnormally high frequency of mutation within the haploid gametes of p53-null parents. {\textcopyright} 1995 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Three-dimensional neural organoids are emerging tools with the potential for improving our understanding of human brain development and neurological disorders. Recent advances in this field have demonstrated their capacity to model neurogenesis, neuronal migration and positioning, and even response to sensory input. However, it remains to be seen whether these tissues can model axon guidance dynamics and the formation of complex connectivity with functional neuronal output. Here, we have established a long-term air-liquid interface culture paradigm that leads to improved neuronal survival and allows for imaging of axon guidance. Over time, these cultures spontaneously form thick axon tracts capable of projecting over long distances. Axon bundles display various morphological behaviors including intracortical projection within and across the organoid, growth cone turning, decussation, and projection away from the organoid. Single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals the full repertoire of cortical neuronal identities, and retrograde labelling demonstrates these tract morphologies match the appropriate molecular identities, namely callosal and corticofugal neuron types. We show that these neurons are functionally mature, generate active networks within the organoid, and that extracortical projecting tracts innervate and activate mouse spinal cord-muscle explants. Muscle contractions can be evoked by stimulation of the organoid, while axotomy of the innervating tracts abolishes the muscle contraction response, demonstrating dependence on connection with the organoid. Overall, these results reveal a remarkable self-organization of corticofugal and callosal tracts with a functional output, providing new opportunities to examine relevant aspects of human CNS development and response to injury.},

Classical lissencephaly is characterized by smooth cerebral surface and cortical thickening that result in seizures, severe neurological impairment and developmental delay. Mutations in the X-chromosomal gene DCX, encoding doublecortin, is the main cause of classical lissencephaly. Much of our knowledge about DCX-associated lissencephaly comes from post-mortem analyses of patient/'s brains, mainly since animal models with DCX mutations do not mimic the disease. In the absence of relevant animal models and patient brain specimens, we took advantage of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to model the disease. We established human iPSCs from two males with mutated DCX and classical lissencephaly including smooth brain and abnormal cortical morphology. The disease was recapitulated by differentiation of iPSC into neural cells followed by expression profiling and dissection of DCX-associated functions. Here we show that neural stem cells, with absent or reduced DCX protein expression, exhibit impaired migration, delayed differentiation and deficient neurite formation. Hence, the patient-derived iPSCs and neural stem cells provide a system to further unravel the functions of DCX in normal development and disease.},

abstract = {In vitro models of the developing brain such as three-dimensional brain organoids offer an unprecedented opportunity to study aspects of human brain development and disease. However, the cells generated within organoids and the extent to which they recapitulate the regional complexity, cellular diversity and circuit functionality of the brain remain undefined. Here we analyse gene expression in over 80,000 individual cells isolated from 31 human brain organoids. We find that organoids can generate a broad diversity of cells, which are related to endogenous classes, including cells from the cerebral cortex and the retina. Organoids could be developed over extended periods (more than 9 months), allowing for the establishment of relatively mature features, including the formation of dendritic spines and spontaneously active neuronal networks. Finally, neuronal activity within organoids could be controlled using light stimulation of photosensitive cells, which may offer a way to probe the functionality of human neuronal circuits using physiological sensory stimuli.},

The high-grade brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is considered a cancer of unmet clinical need, in part due to GBM cell infiltration into healthy brain parenchyma, making complete surgical resection improbable. Modeling the process of GBM invasion in real time is challenging as it requires both tumor and neural tissue compartments. Here, we demonstrate that human GBM spheroids possess the ability to spontaneously infiltrate early-stage cerebral organoids (eCOs). The resulting formation of hybrid organoids demonstrated an invasive tumor phenotype that was distinct from noncancerous adult neural progenitor (NP) spheroid incorporation into eCOs. These findings provide a basis for the modeling and quantification of the GBM infiltration process using a stem-cell-based organoid approach, and may be used for the identification of anti-GBM invasion strategies.},

We report here our attempt to generate such reagents: monoclonal antibodies against the most common R175H, R248Q, and R273H hotspot mutants of the tumor suppressor p53. These antibodies recognize their intended specific alterations without any cross-reactivity against wild-type (WT) p53 or other p53 mutants, including at the same position (as exemplified by anti-R248Q antibody, which does not recognize the R248W mutation), evaluated by direct immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence methods on transfected and endogenous proteins. Moreover, their clinical utility to diagnose the presence of specific p53 mutants in human tumor microarrays by immunohistochemistry is also shown. Together, the data demonstrate that antibodies against specific single-amino-acid alterations can be generated reproducibly and highlight their utility, which could potentially be extended to therapeutic settings. Hwang et al. generate mutation-specific monoclonal antibodies with high sensitivity and specificity against three of the most common p53 hotspot mutations. These reagents represent the next generation of antibodies against single-amino-acid alterations, which could have potential in the diagnosis and therapeutic targeting of the many alterations found in disease states.},

abstract = {Centrosomes direct spindle morphogenesis to assemble a bipolar mitotic apparatus to enable error-free chromosome segregation and preclude chromosomal instability (CIN). Amplified centrosomes, a hallmark of cancer cells, set the stage for CIN, which underlies malignant transformation and evolution of aggressive phenotypes. Several studies report CIN and a tumorigenic and/or aggressive transformation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-depleted cells. Although several nuclear-encoded proteins are implicated in centrosome duplication and spindle organization, the involvement of mtDNA encoded proteins in centrosome amplification (CA) remains elusive. Here we show that disruption of mitochondrial function by depletion of mtDNA induces robust CA and mitotic aberrations in osteosarcoma cells. We found that overexpression of Aurora A, Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), and Cyclin E was associated with emergence of amplified centrosomes. Supernumerary centrosomes in rho0 (mtDNA-depleted) cells resulted in multipolar mitoses bearing "real" centrosomes with paired centrioles at the multiple poles. This abnormal phenotype was recapitulated by inhibition of respiratory complex I in parental cells, suggesting a role for electron transport chain (ETC) in maintaining numeral centrosomal homeostasis. Furthermore, rho0 cells displayed a decreased proliferative capacity owing to a G 2/M arrest. Downregulation of nuclear-encoded p53 in rho0 cells underscores the importance of mitochondrial and nuclear genome crosstalk and may perhaps underlie the observed mitotic aberrations. By contrast, repletion of wild-type mtDNA in rho0 cells (cybrid) demonstrated a much lesser extent of CA and spindle multipolarity, suggesting partial restoration of centrosomal homeostasis. Our study provides compelling evidence to implicate the role of mitochondria in regulation of centrosome duplication, spindle architecture, and spindle pole integrity.},

abstract = {More than thirty years elapsed since a protein, not yet called p53 at the time, was detected to bind SV40 during viral infection. Thousands of papers later, p53 evolved as the main tumor suppressor involved in growth arrest and apoptosis. A lot has been done but the protein has not yet revealed all its secrets. Particularly important is the observation that in totally distinct pathologies where apoptosis is either exacerbated or impaired, p53 appears to play a central role. This is exemplified for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases that represent the two main causes of age-related neurodegenerative affections, where cell death enhancement appears as one of the main etiological paradigms. Conversely, in cancers, about half of the cases are linked to mutations in p53 leading to the impairment of p53-dependent apoptosis. The involvement of p53 in these pathologies has driven a huge amount of studies aimed at designing chemical tools or biological approaches to rescue p53 defects or over-activity. Here, we describe the data linking p53 to neurodegenerative diseases and brain cancers, and we document the various strategies to interfere with p53 dysfunctions in these disorders. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, a major challenge to our understanding of astrocyte physiology and pathology is the restriction of studies to animal models, human post-mortem brain tissues, or samples obtained from invasive surgical procedures. Here, we report a protocol to generate human functional astrocytes from cerebral organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells. The cellular isolation of cerebral organoids yielded cells that were morphologically and functionally like astrocytes. Immunolabelling and proteomic assays revealed that human organoid-derived astrocytes express the main astrocytic molecular markers, including glutamate transporters, specific enzymes and cytoskeletal proteins. We found that organoid-derived astrocytes strongly supported neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth and responded to ATP through transient calcium wave elevations, which are hallmarks of astrocyte physiology. Additionally, these astrocytes presented similar functional pathways to those isolated from adult human cortex by surgical procedures. This is the first study to provide proteomic and functional analyses of astrocytes isolated from human cerebral organoids. The isolation of these astrocytes holds great potential for the investigation of developmental and evolutionary features of the human brain and provides a useful approach to drug screening and neurodegenerative disease modelling.},

They develop from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), most of which divide a limited number of times before they stop and differentiate. OPCs can be purified from the developing rat optic nerve and stimulated to proliferate in serum-free culture by PDGF. They can be induced to differentiate in vitro by either thyroid hormone (TH) or PDGF withdrawal. It was shown previously that a dominant-negative form of p53 could inhibit OPC differentiation induced by TH but not by PDGF withdrawal, suggesting that the p53 family of proteins might play a part in TH-induced differentiation. As the dominant-negative p53 used inhibited all three known p53 family members - p53, p63 and p73 - it was uncertain which family members are important for this process. Here, we provide evidence that both p53 and p73, but not p63, are involved in TH-induced OPC differentiation and that p73 also plays a crucial part in PDGF-withdrawal-induced differentiation. This is the first evidence for a role of p73 in the differentiation of a normal mammalian cell.},

These epithelial cells line the cerebral ventricles and generate intermediate progenitor cells that migrate into the subventricular zone (SVZ) and proliferate to increase neuronal number. The developing human SVZ has a massively expanded outer region (OSVZ) thought to contribute to cortical size and complexity. However, OSVZ progenitor cell types and their contribution to neurogenesis are not well understood. Here we show that large numbers of radial glia-like cells and intermediate progenitor cells populate the human OSVZ. We find that OSVZ radial glia-like cells have a long basal process but, surprisingly, are non-epithelial as they lack contact with the ventricular surface. Using real-time imaging and clonal analysis, we demonstrate that these cells can undergo proliferative divisions and self-renewing asymmetric divisions to generate neuronal progenitor cells that can proliferate further. We also show that inhibition of Notch signalling in OSVZ progenitor cells induces their neuronal differentiation. The establishment of non-ventricular radial glia-like cells may have been a critical evolutionary advance underlying increased cortical size and complexity in the human brain.},

Our data showed that miR-302 directly suppresses the tumor suppressor p53, which is modestly upregulated in Dgcr8−/−ESCs and serves as a barrier restricting neural differentiation. We demonstrated that direct inactivation of p53 by SV40 large T antigen, a short hairpin RNA against Trp53, or genetic ablation of Trp53 in Dgcr8−/−PSCs enables neural differentiation, while activation of p53 by the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3a in wild-type ESCs inhibits neural differentiation. Together, we demonstrate that a major function of miRNAs in neural differentiation is suppression of p53 and that modest activation of p53 blocks neural differentiation of miRNA-deficient PSCs. In this article, Zhao and colleagues show that expression of miR-302 is sufficient to enable neural differentiation of differentiation-incompetent Dgcr8−/−ESCs.

abstract = {In the developing nervous system, neural stem cells are polarized and maintain an apical domain facing a central lumen. The presence of apical membrane is thought to have a profound influence on maintaining the stem cell state. With the onset of neurogenesis, cells lose their polarization, and the concomitant loss of the apical domain coincides with a loss of the stem cell identity. Little is known about the molecular signals controlling apical membrane size. Here, we use two neuroepithelial cell systems, one derived from regenerating axolotl spinal cord and the other from human embryonic stem cells, to identify a molecular signaling pathway initiated by lysophosphatidic acid that controls apical membrane size and consequently controls and maintains epithelial organization and lumen size in neuroepithelial rosettes. This apical domain size increase occurs independently of effects on proliferation and involves a serum response factor-dependent transcriptional induction of junctional and apical membrane components. Medelnik and colleagues identify lysophosphatidic acid as a serum factor that has a major effect on the expansion of the apical domain of human ESC-derived neural progenitor cells, resulting in the formation of very large neural rosette-like structures that can be maintained for many passages in the absence of neuronal and glial differentiation if constantly supplied with LPA.},

abstract = {The initial observation that p53 accumulation might serve as a surrogate biomarker for TP53 mutation has been the cornerstone for vast translational efforts aimed at validating its clinical use for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cancer. Early on, it was realized that accurate evaluation of p53 status and function could not be achieved through protein-expression analysis only. As our understanding of the p53 pathway has evolved and more sophisticated methods for assessment of p53 functional integrity have become available, the clinical and molecular epidemiological implications of p53 abnormalities in cancers are being revealed. They include diagnostic testing for germline p53 mutations, and the assessment of selected p53 mutations as biomarkers of carcinogen exposure and cancer risk and prognosis. Here, we describe the strengths and limitations of the most frequently used techniques for determination of p53 status in tumors, as well as the most remarkable latest findings relating to its clinical and epidemiological value.},

abstract = {The role of multipotential progenitors and neural stem cells in the adult subventricular zone (SVZ) as cell-of-origin of glioblastoma has been suggested by studies on human tumors and transgenic mice. However, it is still unknown whether glial tumors are generated by all of the heterogeneous SVZ cell types or only by specific subpopulations of cells. It has been proposed that transformation could result from lack of apoptosis and increased self-renewal, but the definition of the properties leading to neoplastic transformation of SVZ cells are still elusive. This study addresses these questions in mice carrying the deletion of p53, a tumor-suppressor gene expressed in the SVZ. We show here that, although loss of p53 by itself is not sufficient for tumor formation, it provides a proliferative advantage to the slow- and fast-proliferating subventricular zone (SVZ) populations associated with their rapid differentiation. This results in areas of increased cell density that are distributed along the walls of the lateral ventricles and often associated with increased p53-independent apoptosis. Transformation occurs when loss of p53 is associated with a mutagenic stimulus and is characterized by dramatic changes in the properties of the quiescent adult SVZ cells, including enhanced self-renewal, recruitment to the fast-proliferating compartment, and impaired differentiation. Together, these findings provide a cellular mechanism for how the slow-proliferating SVZ cells can give rise to glial tumors in the adult brain.},

abstract = {Organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells recapitulate the early three-dimensional organization of the human brain, but whether they establish the epigenomic and transcriptional programs essential for brain development is unknown. We compared epigenomic and regulatory features in cerebral organoids and human fetal brain, using genome-wide, base resolution DNA methylome and transcriptome sequencing. Transcriptomic dynamics in organoids faithfully modeled gene expression trajectories in early-to-mid human fetal brains. We found that early non-CG methylation accumulation at super-enhancers in both fetal brain and organoids marks forthcoming transcriptional repression in the fully developed brain. Demethylated regions (74{\%} of 35,627) identified during organoid differentiation overlapped with fetal brain regulatory elements. Interestingly, pericentromeric repeats showed widespread demethylation in multiple types of in vitro human neural differentiation models but not in fetal brain. Our study reveals that organoids recapitulate many epigenomic features of mid-fetal human brain and also identified novel non-CG methylation signatures of brain development.},

However, factor-mediated direct reprogramming is generally regarded as an inefficient and stochastic event. Contrary to this notion, we herein demonstrate that most human adult dermal fibroblasts initiated the reprogramming process on receiving the OSKM transgenes. Within 7 d, {\~{}}20{\%} of these transduced cells became positive for the TRA-1-60 antigen, one of the most specific markers of human pluripotent stem cells. However, only a small portion ({\~{}}1{\%}) of these nascent reprogrammed cells resulted in colonies of induced pluripotent stem cells after replating. We found that many of the TRA-1-60-positive cells turned back to be negative again during the subsequent culture. Among the factors that have previously been reported to enhance direct reprogramming, LIN28, but not Nanog homeobox (NANOG), Cyclin D1, or p53 shRNA, significantly inhibited the reversion of reprogramming. These data demonstrate that maturation, and not initiation, is the limiting step during the direct reprogramming of human fibroblasts toward pluripotency and that each proreprogramming factor has a different mode of action.},

abstract = {Over the past decades, the importance of the immune system in a broad scope of pathologies, has drawn attention towards tissue-resident macrophages, such as microglia in the brain. To enable the study of for instance microglia, it is crucial to recreate in vitro (and in vivo) assays. However, very fast loss of tissue-specific features of primary tissue resident macrophages, including microglia, upon in vitro culture has complicated such studies. Moreover, limited knowledge of macrophage developmental pathways and the role of local ‘niche factors' has hampered the generation of tissue-resident macrophages from pluripotent stem cells (PSC). Recent data on the ontogeny of tissue-resident macrophages, combined with bulk and single cell RNAseq studies have identified the distinct origins and gene profile of microglia compared to other myeloid cells. As a result, over the past years, protocols have been published to create hPSC-derived microglia-‘like' cells, as these cells are considered potential new therapeutic targets for therapies to treat neurodegenerative diseases. In this review we will provide an overview of different approaches taken to generate human microglia in vitro, taking into account their origin, and resemblance to their in vivo counterpart. Finally, we will discuss cell-extrinsic (culture conditions) and intrinsic factors (transcriptional machinery and epigenetics) that we believe can improve future differentiation protocols of tissue-resident macrophages from stem cells.},

The IARC TP53 Database (http://p53.iarc.fr) is a popular resource that compiles occurrence and phenotype data on TP53 germline and somatic variations linked to human cancer. The deluge of data coming from cancer genomic studies generates new data on TP53 variations and attracts a growing number of database users for the interpretation of TP53 variants. Here, we present the current contents and functionalities of the IARC TP53 Database and perform a systematic analysis of TP53 somatic mutation data extracted from this database and from genomic data repositories. This analysis showed that IARC has more TP53 somatic mutation data than genomic repositories (29,000 vs. 4,000). However, the more complete screening achieved by genomic studies highlighted some overlooked facts about TP53 mutations, such as the presence of a significant number of mutations occurring outside the DNA-binding domain in specific cancer types. We also provide an update on TP53 inherited variants including the ones that should be considered as neutral frequent variations. We thus provide an update of current knowledge on TP53 variations in human cancer as well as inform users on the efficient use of the IARC TP53 Database},

However, the precise roles of p73 isoforms in cellular events such as tumor initiation, embryonic development, and cell death remain unclear. To determine which aspects of p73 function are attributable to the TAp73 isoforms, we generated and characterized mice in which exons encoding the TAp73 isoforms were specifically deleted to create a TAp73-deficient (TAp73(-/-)) mouse. Here we show that mice specifically lacking in TAp73 isoforms develop a phenotype intermediate between the phenotypes of Trp73(-/-) and Trp53(-/-) mice with respect to incidence of spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumors, infertility, and aging, as well as hippocampal dysgenesis. In addition, cells from TAp73(-/-) mice exhibit genomic instability associated with enhanced aneuploidy, which may account for the increased incidence of spontaneous tumors observed in these mutants. Hence, TAp73 isoforms exert tumor-suppressive functions and indicate an emerging role for Trp73 in the maintenance of genomic stability.},

abstract = {TP53 (p53) is the single most frequently altered gene in human cancers, with mutations being present in approximately 50{\%} of all invasive tumours. However, in some of the most difficult-to-treat cancers such as high-grade serous ovarian cancers, triple-negative breast cancers, oesophageal cancers, small-cell lung cancers and squamous cell lung cancers, p53 is mutated in at least 80{\%} of samples. Clearly, therefore, mutant p53 protein is an important candidate target against which new anticancer treatments could be developed. Although traditionally regarded as undruggable, several compounds such as p53 reactivation and induction of massive apoptosis-1 (PRIMA-1), a methylated derivative and structural analogue of PRIMA-1, i.e. APR-246, 2-sulfonylpyrimidines such as PK11007, pyrazoles such as PK7088, zinc metallochaperone-1 (ZMC1), a third generation thiosemicarbazone developed by Critical Outcome Techonologies Inc. (COTI-2) as well as specific peptides have recently been reported to reactive mutant p53 protein by converting it to a form exhibiting wild-type properties. Consistent with the reactivation of mutant p53, these compounds have been shown to exhibit anticancer activity in preclinical models expressing mutant p53. To date, two of these compounds, i.e. APR-246 and COTI-2 have progressed to clinical trials. A phase I/IIa clinical trial with APR-246 reported no major adverse effect. Currently, APR-246 is undergoing a phase Ib/II trial in patients with advanced serous ovarian cancer, while COTI-2 is being evaluated in a phase I trial in patients with advanced gynaecological cancers. It remains to be shown however, whether any mutant p53 reactivating compound has efficacy for the treatment of human cancer.},

In cells undergoing terminal differentiation, the level of p53 mRNA declined strongly. In the brain, hybridisation signals were also observed in postmitotic but not yet terminally differentiated cells.

abstract = {Lissencephaly comprises a spectrum of brain malformations due to impaired neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex. Classical lissencephaly is characterized by smooth cerebral surface and cortical thickening that result in seizures, severe neurological impairment and developmental delay. Mutations in the X-chromosomal gene DCX, encoding doublecortin, is the main cause of classical lissencephaly. Much of our knowledge about DCX-associated lissencephaly comes from post-mortem analyses of patient/'s brains, mainly since animal models with DCX mutations do not mimic the disease. In the absence of relevant animal models and patient brain specimens, we took advantage of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to model the disease. We established human iPSCs from two males with mutated DCX and classical lissencephaly including smooth brain and abnormal cortical morphology. The disease was recapitulated by differentiation of iPSC into neural cells followed by expression profiling and dissection of DCX-associated functions. Here we show that neural stem cells, with absent or reduced DCX protein expression, exhibit impaired migration, delayed differentiation and deficient neurite formation. Hence, the patient-derived iPSCs and neural stem cells provide a system to further unravel the functions of DCX in normal development and disease.},

abstract = {Sox2 is one of the earliest known transcription factors expressed in the developing neural tube. Although it is expressed throughout the early neuroepithelium, we show that its later expression must depend on the activity of more than one regionally restricted enhancer element. Thus, by using transgenic assays and by homologous recombination-mediated deletion, we identify a region upstream of Sox2 (-5.7 to -3.3 kb) which can not only drive expression of a (beta)-geo transgene to the developing dorsal telencephalon, but which is required to do so in the context of the endogenous gene. The critical enhancer can be further delimited to an 800 bp fragment of DNA surrounding a nuclease hypersensitive site within this region, as this is sufficient to confer telencephalic expression to a 3.3 kb fragment including the Sox2 promoter, which is otherwise inactive in the CNS. Expression of the 5.7 kb Sox2(beta)-geo transgene localizes to the neural plate and later to the telencephalic ventricular zone. We show, by in vitro clonogenic assays, that transgene-expressing (and thus G418-resistant) ventricular zone cells include cells displaying functional properties of stem cells, i.e. self-renewal and multipotentiality. We further show that the majority of telencephalic stem cells express the transgene, and this expression is largely maintained over two months in culture (more than 40 cell divisions) in the absence of G418 selective pressure. In contrast, stem cells grown in parallel from the spinal cord never express the transgene, and die in G418. Expression of endogenous telencephalic genes was similarly observed in long-term cultures derived from the dorsal telencephalon, but not in spinal cord-derived cultures. Thus, neural stem cells of the midgestation embryo are endowed with region-specific gene expression (at least with respect to some networks of transcription factors, such as that driving telencephalic expression of the Sox2 transgene), which can be inherited through multiple divisions outside the embryonic environment.},

abstract = {Mutations in p53 are almost synonymous with cancer - be it susceptibility to the disease or response to treatment - and therefore, are a critical determinant of overall survival. As most of these mutations occur in the DNA-binding domain of p53, many of the clinical correlations with mutant p53 have been initially relegated to the loss of its transcription-dependent activities as a tumor suppressor. However, significant efforts over the last two decades have led to the vast knowledge on the potential functions of the mutated p53 protein, which have been attributed to the physical presence of the mutant protein rather than the loss of its wild-type (WT) functions. Beyond the inhibitory effects of mutant p53 on the remaining WT protein that leads to the dominant-negative effect in the heterozygous state, mutant p53's presence has also been significantly attributed to novel gain-of-functions that lead to addiction of cancer cells to its presence for survival, as well as for their ability to invade and metastasize, elevating it to a contrived oncogene that drives the cancer cells forward. This review will summarize the functional consequences of the presence of mutant p53 protein on cellular and organismal physiology.},

abstract = {The tumor suppressor protein p53 (Trp53) and the cell cycle inhibitor p27(Kip1) (Cdknb1) have both been implicated in regulating proliferation of adult subventricular zone (aSVZ) cells. We previously reported that genetic ablation of Trp53 (Trp53-/-) or Cdknb1 (p27(Kip1-/-) ) increased proliferation of cells in the aSVZ, but differentially affected the number of adult born neuroblasts. We therefore hypothesized that these molecules might play non-redundant roles. To test this hypothesis we generated mice lacking both genes (Trp53-/- ;p27(Kip1-/-) ) and analysed the consequences on aSVZ cells and adult neuroblasts. Proliferation and self-renewal of cultured aSVZ cells were increased in the double mutants compared with control, but the mice did not develop spontaneous brain tumors. In contrast, the number of adult-born neuroblasts in the double mutants was similar to wild-type animals and suggested a complementation of the p27(Kip1-/-) phenotype due to loss of Trp53. Cellular differences detected in the aSVZ correlated with cellular changes in the olfactory bulb and behavioral data on novel odor recognition. The exploration time for new odors was reduced in p27(Kip1-/-) mice, increased in Trp53-/- mice and normalized in the double Trp53-/- ;p27(Kip1-/-) mutants. At the molecular level, Trp53-/- aSVZ cells were characterized by higher levels of NeuroD and Math3 and by the ability to generate neurons more readily. In contrast, p27(Kip1-/-) cells generated fewer neurons, due to enhanced proteasomal degradation of pro-neural transcription factors. Together, these results suggest that p27(Kip1) and p53 function non-redundantly to modulate proliferation and self-renewal of aSVZ cells and antagonistically in regulating adult neurogenesis.},

Their stem cell properties, including self-renewal and their potential to virtually differentiate into any cell type, emphasize their importance as a translational tool for modeling disorders that so far have been limited by the unavailability of primary cell lines, animal models, or inaccessible human materials. Around 100 genes with germline mutations have been described to be responsible for cancer predisposition. Familial cancers are usually diagnosed earlier in life since these patients already carry the first transforming hit. Deriving iPS cells from patients suffering from familial cancers provides a valuable tool for understanding the mechanisms underlying pediatric cancer onset and progression since they require less mutation recurrence than adult cancers to develop. At the same time, some familial mutations are found in sporadic cases and are a valuable prognostic tool. Patient-derived iPS cells from germline malignancies can also create new tools in developing specific drugs with more personalized-therapy strategies.},

abstract = {Following spinal trauma, the limited physiological axonal sprouting that contributes to partial recovery of function is dependent upon the intrinsic properties of neurons as well as the inhibitory glial environment. The transcription factor p53 is involved in DNA repair, cell cycle, cell survival, and axonal outgrowth, suggesting p53 as key modifier of axonal and glial responses influencing functional recovery following spinal injury. Indeed, in a spinal cord dorsal hemisection injury model, we observed a significant impairment in locomotor recovery in p53(-/-) versus wild-type mice. p53(-/-) spinal cords showed an increased number of activated microglia/macrophages and a larger scar at the lesion site. Loss-and gain-of-function experiments suggested p53 as a direct regulator of microglia/macrophages proliferation. At the axonal level, p53(-/-) mice showed a more pronounced dieback of the corticospinal tract (CST) and a decreased sprouting capacity of both CST and spinal serotoninergic fibers. In vivo expression of p53 in the sensorimotor cortex rescued and enhanced the sprouting potential of the CST in p53(-/-) mice, while, similarly, p53 expression in p53(-/-) cultured cortical neurons rescued a defect in neurite outgrowth, suggesting a direct role for p53 in regulating the intrinsic sprouting ability of CNS neurons. In conclusion, we show that p53 plays an important regulatory role at both extrinsic and intrinsic levels affecting the recovery of motor function following spinal cord injury. Therefore, we propose p53 as a novel potential multilevel therapeutic target for spinal cord injury.},

One specific example is astrocytes, recently recognized for contribution to neurological diseases and a link to the genetic risk factor apolipoprotein E (APOE). Current astrocytic in vitro models are questioned for lack of biological characterization. Here, we report human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived astroglia (NES-Astro) developed under defined conditions through long-term neuroepithelial-like stem (ltNES) cells. We characterized NES-Astro and astrocytic models from primary sources, astrocytoma (CCF-STTG1), and hiPSCs through transcriptomics, proteomics, glutamate uptake, inflammatory competence, calcium signaling response, and APOE secretion. Finally, we assess modulation of astrocyte biology using APOE-annotated compounds, confirming hits of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in adult and hiPSC-derived astrocytes. Our data show large diversity among astrocytic models and emphasize a cellular context when studying astrocyte biology. Human studies can typically not be used to understand cellular functions of the brain. Astrocytes, important for neuronal circuit regulation and support, lack cellular model characterization and biological translation. Falk, Herland, and colleagues report striking differences in astrocyte models. A pilot screen of Alzheimer's disease-related drugs demonstrates dependence between compound hit finding and astrocytic model biology.},

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can be differentiated into in vitro counterparts of the neural crest, and some of the signals known to induce neural crest formation in vivo are required during this process. However, the protocols in current use tend to produce variable results, and there is no consensus as to the precise signals required for optimal neural crest differentiation. Using a fully defined culture system, we have now found that the efficient differentiation of hPSCs to neural crest depends on precise levels of BMP signaling, which are vulnerable to fluctuations in endogenous BMP production. We present a method that controls for this phenomenon and could be applied to other systems where endogenous signaling can also affect the outcome of differentiation protocols. Hackland and colleagues have developed a method for the generation of human neural crest cells that allows their use in clinical applications. Their method allows for greater control over the environment of the cells by managing the influence of cell-produced signals, and this approach could be applied to other systems.},

Contrary to expectation, recent genetic evidence in mice indicates that the response of p53 to DNA damage has little or no impact on cancer protection. In contrast, ARF-dependent activation of p53 is critical for p53-mediated tumor suppression.
